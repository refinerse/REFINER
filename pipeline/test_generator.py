## Execution Environment
- The test runs inside a Docker container with the repo source code at `/workspace/` (which is the working directory).
- The repo package is installed. Standard library and repo dependencies are available.
- The test file is placed at `/workspace/<test_filename>` (repo root level).
- When referencing source files, ALWAYS use absolute paths starting with `/workspace/` (e.g. `/workspace/{context.file_path}`). NEVER use `__file__` or `os.path.dirname(__file__)` to locate source files.
- pytest runs with `-c /dev/null` (repo pytest config is ignored — no custom plugins or conftest).
